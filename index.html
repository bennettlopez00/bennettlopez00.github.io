                <h1>Hello! My Name is Bennett Lopez</h1>
                <p>
                    I am currently enrolled as a Junior in the school of Computer Science with an emphasis in Cyber Security at George Fox University. I'm a fast learner, quick on my feet, and a people person. I'm eager to pursue any challenge that I come across, and have a positive impact on my workplace.

            <div class= "cell body-1"><h1>What Can I do? </h1>
            <p>
                I am proficient in computer languages such as Java, Python and C++, along with other smaller languages such as Scala, Veralog, ARM assembly. I excel in database queries, management and creation. I am constantly engaged in the software development process, and eger to know what I don't know. And then go learn it!
            </p>

            <div class= "cell photo-1"><img src="stock_photo.jpg" alt="myPicture" ></div>
            <div class= "cell photo-2"><img src="image1.jpg" alt="myPicture" ></div>
            <div class= "cell body-2"><h1>Why me?</h1>
            <p>Because I have a proven track record of persistence, reliability and determination. I do not put my name on anything that I am 100% confident in it's quality and utility. I have no issue picking up new skills, working on them until it becomes second nature. Why me? Because of my drive. </p>
